# Sales Income Calculator

## Overview
This Java program calculates income based on sales amounts, considering different tiers of commission rates. The program uses a loop to iterate through various sales amounts and computes the corresponding income.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the `cop2805` package.
2. Open the `Main.java` file in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Run the `Main` class.

## Program Logic
The program defines a `Main` class with a `main` method that initializes a sales amount and iterates through a loop to display sales and income information. The income is calculated using the `computeIncome` method, which considers different commission rates based on sales tiers.

### Sales Tiers:
- Tier 1: Sales up to $5000, 8% commission
- Tier 2: Sales from $5000.01 to $10000, 10% commission
- Tier 3: Sales over $10000, 12% commission

## Output
The program generates a table displaying sales and corresponding income for incremental sales amounts. The output is structured as follows:
